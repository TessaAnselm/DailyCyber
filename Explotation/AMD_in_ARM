32 bit in ARM

To run 32-bit programs on ARM, a common hurdle is setting up a suitable environment. One solution is to install Debian (x86/amd64) on UTM. You can follow the detailed instructions provided below found from: https://samsclass.info/127/proj/LocalDebian12.htm

Tools Required to Compile 32-bit Programs:
Run the following command to install the necessary packages. This will install essential tools like GCC (with multilib support) and GDB to compile and debug 32-bit programs.
sudo apt install build-essential gcc-multilib gdb -y
